# Predicting-ENERGY-STAR-Score


ENERGY STAR score is an external benchmark for assessing the energy performance of commercial buildings. The ENERGY STAR score is expressed as a number on a simple 1 - 100 scale. First introduced in 1999, the score has been adopted by leading organizations across the United States because it offers a simple way to evaluate measured energy use, prioritize investments, and communicate relative performance across a portfolio of buildings.

The goal is to predict the ENERGY STAR Score of a building based on historical data. 

This is a Supervised learning approach where Regression models have been used to make predictions.
